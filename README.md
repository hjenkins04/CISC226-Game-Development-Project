# CISC226 Game Development Project

"Frostfall" is a 2D vertical platformer where players control a rugged mountaineer navigating a challenging, winter mountain and castle setting using a grappling gun and pickaxe as tools. Players must also engage in combat with enemies being rewarded for precision and timing of attacks, enhancing the overall strategic gameplay. The main goal is to reach the end of the map by defeating bosses and overcoming obstacles. “Frostfall” targets players aged 10-30, offering a progressively challenging experience while remaining accessible to players of varying skill levels.
